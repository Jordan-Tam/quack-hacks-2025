## Team Name: The Stevens Scheduling Guides

## Description:

Our project improves access to education and education quality for Stevens Computer Science Students by making course selection more seamless and efficient than ever. Currently, it is very difficult for students to map out a course plan for their remaining semesters at Stevens. Course prerequisites are difficult to track, and Workday does not provide any guidance on satisfying a study plan. Academic advisors are awesome, but they are also human. The Course Pond eliminates all fears and confusions, giving students a scheduling guide they can fully trust. Our project serves as a tool that is supplemental to Workday- a resource that guides students in choosing the classes that best suit both their requirements and interests. Students can input the courses they've already taken and the number of semesters they have left. The rest of the weight is taken off the students' shoulders, as our algorithm calculates the number of courses students have left to take in each category (core courses, technical electives, humanities, etc.). From there, students can simply select the courses they would like to take during each semester, with the Course Pond ensuring they do not break any scheduling rules while doing so. Students can also learn more about courses by simply searching them up, allowing for the most informed decisions possible. In the Course Pond, no duck ever drowns!
